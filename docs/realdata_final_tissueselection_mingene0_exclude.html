The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<pre><code>
Ignored files:

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/index.Rmd

Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
