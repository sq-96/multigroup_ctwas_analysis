The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/sq-96/multigroup_ctwas_analysis/tree/163c010dfe222819c67f4bf0046b4226b50a5d20" target="_blank">163c010</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    results/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/multi_group_6traits_15weights_ukbb.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<li><p>Heritability contribution by contexts: we aggregate the PVE
values by omics and tissues, making it easier to understand the

omics</p></li>
<li><p>Combined PIP by contexts: we aggregate the Susie PIPs by tissues,
making it easier to understand the distribution of PIP across different
genetic contexts.</p></li>
<li><p>Specific molecular traits of top genes: we creates a pie chart to
visualize the proportion of genes classified into different categories
based on their PIPs contributed by each genetics contexts. The
categories are based on the proportion of each QTL type relative to the
combined PIP value:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>by eQTL: Number of genes where the ratio of eQTL to combined PIP is
greater than 0.8.</li>
<li>by sQTL: Number of genes where the ratio of sQTL to combined PIP is
greater than 0.8.</li>
<li>by apaQTL: Number of genes where the ratio of apaQTL to combined PIP
is greater than 0.8.</li>
<li>by sQTL+apaQTL: Number of genes where the combined ratio of apaQTL
and sQTL to combined PIP is greater than 0.8, but neither apaQTL nor
sQTL individually exceed 0.8.</li>
<li>unspecified: Number of genes not classified into any of the above
