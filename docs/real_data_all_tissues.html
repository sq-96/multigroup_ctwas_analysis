Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/sq-96/multigroup_ctwas_analysis/tree/5b1b5c8d17d485c8c9b78e6f4a64961fa3f4f327" target="_blank">5b1b5c8</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For IBD, colon transverse and whole blood have much higher %h2g than other tissues.</li>
<li>For LDL, liver has much higher %h2g than other tissues.</li>
<li>For SBP, the top five ones all make sense, which are artery aorta, brain cortex, artery tibial, cell cultured fibroblasts and adrenal gland.</li>
<li>For WBC, whole blood has much higher %h2g than other tissues.</li>
<li>For SCZ, the top ones are basal ganglia, cerebellum, hippocampus, hemisphere, cortex …</li>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html. This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
