The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    results/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/multi_group_compare_predictdb_munro_4weights_8weights.Rmd
    Modified:   analysis/multi_group_compare_predictdb_munro_updated.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<p>There’s no overlapped genes at combined_pip &gt; 0.8.</p>
<p>We noticed that, when using Munro’s weights, we have GNA12 as the

<p>But when using predictdb weights, we missed this gene.</p>

<p>We noticed that, the 2 SNPs in predictdb weights are either in Munro
