Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/sq-96/multigroup_ctwas_analysis/tree/51219eeacd5f7444f2e245eec5c306b71c971fc4" target="_blank">51219ee</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/figure/

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/multi_group_6traits_15weights_ess_enrichment_genesymbol.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

returns the enriched GO terms with adjusted p-values.</li>
</ul>

<div id="fractional-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Fractional model</h2>
<div id="model" class="section level3">
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>The model is:
<code>glm(PIP ~ gene set membership, family = quasibinomial('log10it'))</code>.
We do this regression for one gene set at a time.</p>
<p>The PIP vector contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>all genes within the credible set: we use their actual PIPs</li>
<li>genes without the credible set &amp; PIP &lt; 0.1: we set the PIPs
as <code>0.5*min(gene pip within credible set)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The 2 different baselines:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All genes from ctwas. Here,
<code>genes without the credible set &amp; PIP &lt; 0.1</code> includes
only the genes used in ctwas.</li>
<li>All genes from the geneset database. Here,

the union of all genes from the GO terms in the geneset database.</li>

<div id="p-value-calibration" class="section level3">
<h3>p-value calibration</h3>
<p>We used <strong>permutation testing</strong> to assess the
significance of associations between <code>combined_pip</code> and GO
terms. Permutation testing creates a “null” distribution by shuffling
data and recalculating p-values.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Initial logistic Regression</strong>: For each GO term, a
logistic regression is performed using
<code>glm(PIP ~ gene set membership, family = quasibinomial('log10it'))</code>.
The observed p-value (<code>pval_origin</code>) measures the association
strength in the actual data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Null Distributions via Permutation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Then we simulate random associations by shuffling the GO term
membership (<code>x</code>) multiple times and recalculating the
logistic regression p-value for each shuffle.</li>
<li>These shuffled p-values represent what would be expected if there
were no real association and create a “null” distribution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Calibrated p-values with Increasing
Permutations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial permutation test uses 1,000 shuffles
(<code>n_permutations = 1000</code>) to compute a calibrated p-value
(<code>pval_calibrated</code>), comparing the observed p-value against
the null distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Further Calibration</strong>: If the calibrated p-value is
significant ( <code>pval_calibrated &lt; 0.05</code>), additional rounds
of permutations (100,000 shuffles) are conducted to improve accuracy for
small p-values. Each round refines the calibrated p-value by expanding
the null distribution, enhancing the robustness of significance
estimates.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Significance</strong>: The final p-value reflects
the proportion of permutation-derived p-values that are more extreme
than the observed one. If only a small number of permutation p-values
are smaller, the association is considered statistically
significant.</p></li>
</ol>
<!-- This multi-stage permutation testing approach minimizes false positives in high-dimensional data, offering a robust significance estimate for associations with initially strong p-values. -->

<h2>Fisher exact test</h2>
<p>We assign 1 to the genes with PIP &gt; 0.5/0.8 &amp; in cs and 0 for

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
