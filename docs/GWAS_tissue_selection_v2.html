The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/GWAS_tissue_selection_v2.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.
