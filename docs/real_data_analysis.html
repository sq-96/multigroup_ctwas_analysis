Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/sq-96/multigroup_ctwas_analysis/tree/49bb0a6b608b09e29ad4675645118b4384dcc9f2" target="_blank">49bb0a6</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/real_data_analysis.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.
</p>
</div>

<div id="versions" class="tab-pane fade">

<p>
These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/real_data_analysis.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/real_data_analysis.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.
