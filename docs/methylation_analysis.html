Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/sq-96/multigroup_ctwas_analysis/tree/d6b7605bfcf3e1ceb127040a2c4aabdbf14ecddd" target="_blank">d6b7605</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/methylation_analysis.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.
</p>
</div>

<p>
These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/methylation_analysis.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/methylation_analysis.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h3>Fusion Lasso model of DNA methylation</h3>
<p>I built lasso model of DNA methylation with FUSION for Whole Blood and Colon Transverse. Similar to meQTL mapping, for each CpG site, I extracted surrounding 50kb genptypes and train lasso models with cross validation. With heritability cutoff p&lt;0.0001, I have about 16,000 and 48,000 CpG sites in whole blood and colon transverse. Among which, 5,000 and 40,000 CpG sites are also in QTL mapping. Colon have more overlaps than whole blood. The average cross-validation R2 for lasso in whole blood and colon transverse are 0.393 and 0.248 In the single QTL approach (qval &lt; 0.001), we have 7,720 and 91,466 CpG sites.</p>

<h4>RGS14</h4>
<p>Examples conserved between the mouse and human DNMT3A-deficient state comprise RGS14 (Regulator of G-protein signaling 14) and IFITM3 (Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3), which showed a canonically increased expression with reduced methylation in the promoter region (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33844-2#MOESM1" class="uri">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33844-2#MOESM1</a>)</p>
<p>Colocalization analysis revealed eight candidate genetic variants and risk genes (including LINC00824, CDKAL1, IL10, IL23R, DNAJC27, LPP, RUNX3, and RGS14) associated with a shared genetic basis. Among these, IL23R, DNAJC27, LPP, and RGS14 were further validated by MVMR analysis.
