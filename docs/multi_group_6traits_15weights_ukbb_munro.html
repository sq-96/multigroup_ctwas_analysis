<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:

Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to

taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
