Genes with Strong Evidence of Association with LDL Cholesterol

LDLR (Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor): Mutations in LDLR are a primary cause of familial hypercholesterolemia, leading to elevated LDL cholesterol levels due to impaired clearance of LDL particles from the bloodstream.

APOB (Apolipoprotein B): APOB encodes the primary protein component of LDL particles. Mutations can impair LDL binding to its receptor, resulting in elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9): PCSK9 regulates LDL receptor degradation. Gain-of-function mutations increase LDL cholesterol levels, while loss-of-function mutations are associated with reduced LDL cholesterol and a lower risk of coronary heart disease.

CETP (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein): CETP facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to LDL and VLDL particles. Variants in CETP can influence HDL and LDL cholesterol levels.
HMGCR (3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase): This enzyme is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis and is the target of statin therapy. Variants in HMGCR can affect LDL cholesterol levels.
NPC1L1 (Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1): NPC1L1 is critical for intestinal cholesterol absorption. Inhibitors like ezetimibe target this protein to reduce LDL cholesterol levels.
ASGR1 (Asialoglycoprotein Receptor 1): Loss-of-function mutations in ASGR1 have been associated with reduced LDL cholesterol levels and a lower risk of coronary artery disease.
APOC1 (Apolipoprotein C1): APOC1 modulates lipoprotein metabolism and has been linked to variations in LDL cholesterol levels.
PSRC1 (Proline and Serine Rich Coiled-Coil 1): Variants near PSRC1 have been linked to LDL cholesterol levels in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
TIMD4 (T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin Domain Containing 4): Variants in TIMD4 have been associated with decreased serum triglyceride levels and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke in certain populations.
